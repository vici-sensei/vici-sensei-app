-- rebuild_kanji_detail_words() derived its freq_score tie-break from the
-- coarse `vocabulary.frequency` tier (high/normal/low/lowest -> 4/3/2/1/0),
-- so most candidate words within the same kanji/reading_group tied on
-- freq_score and fell back to an arbitrary kanji_word_id order. The new
-- `frequency_number` column carries the actual frequency rank behind those
-- tiers (confirmed monotonic with the old tiers: median 17/97/488/4021.5 for
-- lowest/low/normal/high) and is fully populated, so it replaces freq_score
-- directly for much finer-grained, more accurate champion-word selection.
